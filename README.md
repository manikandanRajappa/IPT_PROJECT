   Weather prediction is a complex task that typically involves using data from weather stations, satellites, and various meteorological models. In this example, I'll show you how to get weather forecasts using a Python library called OpenWeatherMap in a Jupyter Notebook. Note that this is a simplified demonstration, and for accurate weather prediction, you should consider using more advanced models and data sources.
#Sign up for OpenWeatherMap API:
                                     Go to the OpenWeatherMap website and sign up for an API key. You'll need this key to access weather data.
#Install required libraries:

In your Jupyter Notebook, install the required libraries, including requests for making HTTP requests and json for working with JSON data.
This code will fetch the current weather data for the specified city. You can modify the city_name variable to get weather information for different locations.

Keep in mind that this is a simple weather lookup example. For more advanced weather forecasting or historical weather data analysis, you would need to explore specialized weather prediction models and datasets, which are typically beyond the scope of a Jupyter Notebook.
